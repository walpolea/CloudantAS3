CloudantAS3
===========

A library to make working with the Cloudant DBaaS system easier. Hopefully a useful tool in building quick datastores for your AIR mobile apps.

Instructions
============

At the moment, just check out CloudantTest.as

This library needs some work, but it's a start... you can write docs to cloudant, read docs from cloudant, and do a primary key query.


Library is dependent on the Base64.swc which I got from here - http://www.sociodox.com/base64.html
